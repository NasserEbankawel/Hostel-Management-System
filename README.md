The Hostel Management System provides a well-structured approach to managing users, hostels, and rooms. 
All users who create accounts are Admins by default and have access to general features such as hostel and room management. 
Super Admins can be added through Laravel Tinker. 
Super Admins have elevated privileges, allowing them to access the Users menu, and manage other users, including removing or suspending accounts.
